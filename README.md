Repository for the MSc thesis "Gamifying Patients for MR Scans Using VR Technology"

The goal of this project was to develop a prototype of a Virtual Reality (VR)
game, which would use gamification to "train" young children to keep their
heads still in preparation for Magnetic Resonance (MR) scans. Currently the
standard procedure is to give young children anesthesia in order to keep them
from moving during MR scans. However, research into the effects of anesthesia
on young minds have shown that it may have neurotoxic effects. Therefore,
efforts are being made in the form of preparation apps to reduce anxiety and
train children in staying still during scans in order to move away from giving
anesthesia.
